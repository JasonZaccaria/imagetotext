<h1>Snap To Text</h1>
<p>This website is a image to text tool that allows users to either drag and drop or upload images and have any text converted into strings for the user to use!</p>
<h1>How does it work?</h1>
<p>This site uses tesseract.js which is a useful tool for utilizing optical character recognition. This library allows us to take any image file and convert any recognizable text into strings that we can then give back to the user.</p>
<h1>What is the purpose of Snap To Text</h1>
<p>The main idea behind this website is to work with unstructured data and make it easily accessible to anyone with a mobile device or computer. In today's day and age being able to handle data thats hard to use data can help expand the tasks we are able to accomplish and make people's lives a lot easier. People spend a lot of time and effort taking scanned images and recopying already notated documentation. This can be simplified and more efficient with an ocr tool like our website and allows people to just upload images and get straight to copying and pasting data instead of having to rewrite what is already writted down or seen from scratch. </p>
